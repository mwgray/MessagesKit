# JPSimulatorHacks

## Description

Hack the Simulator in your tests (grant access to photos, contacts, calendar ...).

Did you ever have the problem that your code was wrapping the `AddressBook`, the `EventKit` or the `ALAssetsLibrary` APIs? Running tests can be annoying then. There's this `UIAlertView` asking the user to grant access to the contacts and photos, which blocks and breaks your tests. Using `JPSimulatorHacks` you can easily grant this access before running your tests.

If you encounter any problems, please check out the [caveats](#caveats)
documented below.

### Installation

Install JPSimulatorHacks with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)

```
pod 'JPSimulatorHacks'
```

## Usage

### AddressBook

```objc
#import <JPSimulatorHacks/JPSimulatorHacks.h>

@implementation MyAppTests

+ (void)setUp
{
    [super setUp];
    [JPSimulatorHacks grantAccessToAddressBook];
}

@end
```

This will grant access to the addressbook for the current bundle identifier.
There's also an API to specify the bundle identifier, if necessary:

```objc
+ (BOOL)grantAccessToAddressBookForBundleIdentifier:(NSString *)bundleIdentifier;
```

### Calendar

```objc
#import <JPSimulatorHacks/JPSimulatorHacks.h>

@implementation MyAppTests

+ (void)setUp
{
    [super setUp];
    [JPSimulatorHacks grantAccessToCalendar];
}

@end
```

This will grant access to the calendar for the current bundle identifier.
There's also an API to specify the bundle identifier, if necessary:

```objc
+ (BOOL)grantAccessToCalendarForBundleIdentifier:(NSString *)bundleIdentifier;
```

### HomeKit

```objc
#import <JPSimulatorHacks/JPSimulatorHacks.h>

@implementation MyAppTests

+ (void)setUp
{
    [super setUp];
    [JPSimulatorHacks grantAccessToHomeKit];
}

@end
```

This will grant access to `HomeKit` for the current bundle identifier.
There's also an API to specify the bundle identifier, if necessary:

```objc
+ (BOOL) grantAccessToHomeKitForBundleIdentifier:(NSString *)bundleIdentifier;
```

### Photos

```objc
#import <JPSimulatorHacks/JPSimulatorHacks.h>

@implementation MyAppTests

+ (void)setUp
{
    [super setUp];
    [JPSimulatorHacks grantAccessToPhotos];
}

@end
```

This will grant access to the photos library for the current bundle identifier.
There's also an API to specify the bundle identifier, if necessary:

```objc
+ (BOOL)grantAccessToPhotosForBundleIdentifier:(NSString *)bundleIdentifier;
```

You can also add some test images from a given URL. The method will block until
the Asset has been stored. This is helpful so your tests will only start after
the Asset is available.

```objc
[JPSimulatorHacks grantAccessToPhotos];
NSURL *assetURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plu/JPSimulatorHacks/master/Data/test.png"];
ALAsset *asset = [JPSimulatorHacks addAssetWithURL:assetURL];
```

### Timeout

By default it tries to write the necessary entries to the `TCC.db` within
15 seconds. If that's not enough time, it just gives up and returns `NO`
from the methods. If for any reason that is not enough time, you can
change this default timeout via:

```objc
+ (void)setUp
{
    [super setUp];
    [JPSimulatorHacks setTimeout:30.0f];
}
```

## Caveats

* `JPSimulatorHacks` only works if unit test suite is run against
real application target: Its `Host Application` *is not* set to `None`!

* When using Xcode bots, sometimes the tests run into an timeout.
* The keyboard helpers have been removed in 1.3.0
